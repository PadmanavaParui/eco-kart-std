# WasteX

**Waste isn't waste. It's inventory.**

WasteX is a B2B waste-trading marketplace: businesses and residential communities list recyclable materials — plastic, paper, cardboard, metal, glass, e-waste — and verified recyclers discover them, place offers, and arrange pickup through a transparent, price-indexed exchange. The financial infrastructure for the circular economy.

WasteX is the evolution of the SmartSort hackathon MVP: the AI waste-classification core (Amazon Rekognition via a swappable API layer) lives on as the **AI material-tagging assist** in the listing flow, and the verified facility registry survives as the **verified-recycler roster**.

## Live backend configuration

Copy `.env.local` (gitignored) with:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://zwy8mv3ihh.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
VITE_MAP_STYLE=https://maps.geo.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/maps/v0/maps/ecokart-map
VITE_MAP_API_KEY=<Amazon Location API key>
```

Production builds **require** this variable: `getApi()` throws a configuration
error if it is missing in a production build — the live app can never silently
fall back to mock data. `mockApi` remains available for unit tests and offline
development only.

### Live map (Amazon Location)

MapView renders real Amazon Location tiles via MapLibre when `VITE_MAP_STYLE`
and `VITE_MAP_API_KEY` are set; without them (or on tile failure) it falls back
to the schematic map. The key is a public API key restricted to `geo:GetMap*`
on the `ecokart-map` resource with referrer allow-listing (localhost for dev;
add the production domain before Amplify deploy) — the frontend-only, keyless-
credential pattern AWS documents for MapLibre. Verified live: style descriptor,
sprites, and tiles all return 200 with the referrer-restricted key, andthe app's referrer-restriction denial behaves correctly (403 without Referer).

### Production deployment (AWS Amplify)

The frontend is live at **https://main.dpp2josj8mc9h.amplifyapp.com** (Amplify
app `ecokart`, id `dpp2josj8mc9h`, region ap-south-1, branch `main`, zip
deployment). The build receives three Vite env vars — `VITE_API_BASE_URL`,
`VITE_MAP_STYLE`, `VITE_MAP_API_KEY` (build-time; no AWS credentials in
Amplify) — so the deployed bundle targets the real API Gateway and Amazon
Location. The map key's referrer allow-list includes the Amplify domain.
`amplify.yml` defines the GitHub-connected build (`nvm use 20` → `npm ci` →
`npm run build` → `dist`); hash routing needs no SPA rewrites.

### CORS

Backend CORS is pinned to exactly two explicit origins (no wildcard):
`http://localhost:5173` (Vite dev) and
`https://main.dpp2josj8mc9h.amplifyapp.com` (production). The list is static in
`backend/template.yaml` (`HttpApi → CorsConfiguration.AllowOrigins` + the
Lambda-side `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` env) — verified live: both origins receive their
exact ACAO echo on preflight and real responses, other origins receive none.
To change the Amplify domain, update the two AllowOrigins entries (template
parameter block is gone; intrinsics are not usable inside
`x-amazon-apigateway-cors`).

Frontend: React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 + Framer Motion + Recharts + react-three-fiber. Backend: serverless AWS — API Gateway, Lambda, Bedrock, DynamoDB, S3 (see [`backend/README.md`](backend/README.md)).

### Authentication + user listings (Phases 3-5)
- Cognito user pool `ap-south-1_RC5nTIYAz` (public web client, email + password, SRP / USER_PASSWORD / refresh flows).
- Frontend session: `src/auth/cognito.ts` (zero-dependency IDP client) + `src/auth/AuthContext.tsx`; the ID token is the API bearer.
- New API routes: `POST /listings` (JWT), `GET /listings/{id}` (public), `GET /my-listings` (JWT, owner-scoped via the GSI on ownerId).
- Listings persist in the separate `smartsort-backend-dev-listings` DynamoDB table; `ownerId` always comes from the verified JWT sub, never the request body.
- Publish flow: anonymous users are redirected to sign-in with their draft preserved; a real device-geolocation fix (when permitted) is stored as pickup coordinates - no fabricated data anywhere.
- SAM note: the inline `AWS::Serverless::HttpApi` authorizer cannot be updated in place by CloudFormation (identity-source / JWT changes are silently skipped). If authorizer config ever changes, delete + redeploy with a new logical id and verify with `aws apigatewayv2 get-authorizers`.
- Physical phone verification is intentionally deferred: responsive/auth/map behavior is verified with automated viewport probes (360-1440px) and desktop E2E; a physical-device checklist remains for the owner. No physical-device verification is claimed.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Marketplace**: Search, multi-facet filters (material, location, price, quantity, quality, pickup date), sorting, and financial-instrument listing cards with live estimated values.
- **Listing details**: Lot specs, seller verification, competing offers, transaction history, pickup-zone map, and a binding Make-an-Offer flow with escrow settlement terms.
- **Create listing wizard**: Six steps — material, quantity & quality, indexed pricing, pickup, photos, review — with AI material tagging from a photo and drag-and-drop uploads.
- **Dual dashboards**: Generator (revenue, volumes, material mix, pickups) and Recycler (spend, active bids, demand index, matched lots) experiences.
- **Transaction tracking**: Six-stage settlement timeline — listing → offer → acceptance → pickup → collection → payment — with escrow and weight-slip reconciliation.
- **Quantified impact**: Tonnes diverted, CO₂e avoided, economic value created, and recovery rate — measured like business metrics.
- **AI material tagging**: Photo → material classification with confidence signal (Bedrock Nova Lite, automatic multi-model fallback), degrading gracefully to manual selection.
- **3D Landing Hero**: A react-three-fiber "materials exchange" sculpture — lazy-loaded so three.js never touches the critical path, skipped on WebGL-less devices and reduced-motion.
- **Offline & mock resilient**: Seamlessly falls back to mock market data when offline or in local demo mode.
- **Serverless AWS Backend**: Production-ready AWS SAM template, AWS Lambda (Node.js 20 & TypeScript), DynamoDB single-table design, and private S3 audit archiving.
